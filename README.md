# morse
Translate text into Morse code. A small project to learn python and git.

## Idea and Credits
I found the basic idea on https://bmu-verlag.de/programmierideen-vorschlaege-fuer-die-umsetzung-eigener-programme/ while I was searching for interesting projects for my son to get an introduction into Python. This project also intends to introduce a basic understanding of git.
